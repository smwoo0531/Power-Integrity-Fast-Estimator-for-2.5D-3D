- Fix a bug (Li Zheng)
	line 49, assign_current.m: should be divided system.Vdd
- Fix a bug (Li Zheng)
	line 45, assign_cap.m: replace "zeros(1:End-start)" with "zeros(1, sum(chip.blk_num))"
		the former creates a largeEnd-start dimensional matrix which is unnecessray
	line 103, assign_current.m: replace "zeros(1:End-start)" with "zeros(1, sum(chip.blk_num))"
		the former creates a largeEnd-start dimensional matrix which is unnecessray
- Fix a bug (Li Zheng)
	line 49, 53, 57, 61, assign_cap.m: remove the outer sum() function
		the outer sum() is not necessary
	line 107, 111, 115, 119, assign_current.m: remove the outer sum() function
		the outer sum() is not necessary

	Matrix_build
	Fix the supply voltage point problems. Remove the current equation because ideal power supply point can provide unlimited current.
	
Oct 9th, 2015 (Yang Zhang)
	Matrix_build
	Fix the inductance assignment issues, finish the whole flow of transient analysis.
	Parameters are required to be well tuned.
